				<h1>About</h1>
				<p> Since 2004, UT Health San Antonio, Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute's (Greehey CCRI)
					mission has been to advance scientific knowledge relevant to childhood cancer, contribute to the
					understanding of its causes, and accelerate the translation of knowledge into novel therapies.
					Through discovery, development, and dissemination of new scientific knowledge, Greehey CCRI
					strives to have a national and global impact on childhood cancer. Our mission consists of three
					key areas â€” research, clinical, and education.</p>

				<h2>Research</h2>
				<p>
					Our strengths include cancer genomics, DNA damage, RNA biology, and drug development. We are
					developing expertise in drug delivery, focusing on nanotechnology-driven delivery of small RNA
					mimics and inhibitors. The Pediatric Translational Working Group, formed as part of the Mays
					Cancer Center P30, meets regularly to coordinate discoveries to develop novel therapies.
				</p>
				<p><strong>Research Focus</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Bioinformatics and genomics</li>
					<li>Cancer biology</li>
					<li>Cancer control</li>
					<li>Experimental therapeutics</li>
					<li>Genome instability</li>
					<li>Molecular oncogenesis</li>
					<li>RNA biology</li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>Core Facilities</strong></p>
				<ul class="margin-bottom">
					<li>Computational biology and bioinformatics</li>
					<li>Genome and exome sequencing</li>
					<li>RNA expression profiling</li>
					<li>PDX generation</li>
					<li>RNAi/CRISPR HTS</li>
					<li>Small molecule HTS</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Clinical</h2>

				<p>
					Greehey CCRI interacts with members of the UT Health San Antonio, <a>Division of Pediatric
						Hematology-Oncology</a> to provide support for clinical research, banking of clinical
					specimens, and
					annotation of such specimens to facilitate patient-oriented research. As our clinical mission
					includes performing research that translates into clinical care, Greehey CCRI supports
					infrastructure for human subjects' research and investigator-initiated trials in pediatric
					cancer. Since much of the research in pediatric cancer includes participation in cooperative
					group trials, Greehey CCRI supports the involvement of investigators in Children's Oncology
					Group participation.

				</p>
				<p class="margin-bottom">
					This year, the <a>UT Health San Antonio MD Anderson Cancer Center</a> has become a member of The
					Pediatric Oncology Experimental Therapeutics Investigators' Consortium (POETIC); pediatric
					oncology studies focus on the biologic basis for anti-cancer therapy, and in particular, attempt
					to explore and evaluate new agents and novel combinations of therapies early in clinical
					development.

				</p>
				<h2>Education</h2>
				<p>
					The educational mission of the Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute is to train the next
					generation of researchers in pediatric cancer research. This includes creating a pipeline of
					trainees through our program for undergraduates engaged in summer research, medical students
					within the MD with Distinction in Research program, fellows in the ACGME-approved
					hematology-oncology fellowship program, as well as the traditional graduate programs in Cancer
					Biology and other relevant areas. We also provide a nurturing home for post-doctoral graduate
					research training. In the past five years, we have graduated eight new PhDs, and trained four
					pediatric oncology fellows as well as hosted several dozen summer undergraduate students.
