            <p>The <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/">Office of Research Integrity (ORI)</a> oversees research integrity
                activities for the Public Health
                Service (PHS), including investigations into research misconduct in research supported by PHS. Their
                site includes general RCR resources, as well as topic-specific resources for the nine core areas of
                research integrity identified by NIH. Materials include interactive videos, case studies, web modules,
                and relevant publications. This site may be of particular relevance to those investigators who are
                supported by NIH funds. See especially the <a

                and the
                Institution of Medicine. On Being a Scientist is designed to supplement informal ethics training
                provided to graduate students and beginning researchers by their mentors and includes
                discussions of
                research misconduct, handling violations of professional standards, laboratory safety,
                intellectual
                property, and the researcher in society.</p>
