					<p>A block quotation (also known as a long quotation or extract) is a quotation in a written document, that is set off from the main text as a paragraph, or block of text, and typically distinguished visually using indentation and a different typeface or smaller size quotation. Blockquotes have no margin/padding of their own and should be placed within another element like a bleed.</p>
