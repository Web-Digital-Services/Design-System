                        1-2
                        sentences (with character limit) on what this story summarizes.</p>
                    <p>Ethnic minorities who have immigrated to the United States have experienced health issues—namely
                        high
                        blood pressure and Type 2 diabetes–and a Korean American researcher at UT Health San Antonio’s
                        School of Nursing wants to find out why.</p>
                    <p>Jisook Ko, Ph.D., M.S.N., RN, assistant professor of nursing, came to the United States in 2011
                        after
                        earning her B.S.N. and M.S.N. at Yonsei University in South Korea.</p>
                    <p>During her first year, she assembled a multi-disciplinary research mentoring team and launched
                        two
                        pilot studies—one focusing on Korean Americans who are experiencing high blood pressure and
                        another
                        focusing on Asian Americans who have developed Type 2 diabetes.</p>
                    <h3 class="color">First Pilot Study: Korean Americans who are experiencing high blood pressure
                    </h3>
                    <p>For the first study of Korean Americans, who are one of the fastest-growing Asian subgroups in
                        the
                        U.S., she is using a finding from her dissertation that Korean Americans “consume 2.5 times more
                        dietary sodium compared with the current recommendations.” Due to “bicultural diet patterns,”
                        she
                        said Korean Americans are mixing the western diet with the Korean contemporary diet, and this
                        contributes to exceptionally high sodium consumption.</p>
                    <p><strong>Diet is a key modifiable risk factor for chronic disease including high blood pressure.
                            While
                            many people take medication to control their high blood pressure, older Korean Americans are
                            hesitant about taking medication.</strong> “They don’t want to start taking the medicine
                        because
                        they think it’s forever,” Dr. Ko explained. “They prefer a dietary approach instead of
                        medication.”
                        Dr. Ko explained. “They prefer a dietary approach instead of medication.”</p>
                    <p>However, most do not benefit from the full potential of dietary modification protective effects.
                        This
                        is due to a number of reasons, including high individual variability in response to certain
                        diets or
                        dietary guidelines and programs. It is now well acknowledged that in order to gain the full
                        benefit
                        of dietary regimes, it is essential to take into account the individual’s response to the diet.
                    </p>
                    <p>This relationship is likely due to the variance of blood pressure response to alterations in
                        dietary
                        sodium intake as well. Salt sensitivity, defined as greater blood pressure response to sodium
                        intake
                        than average, is a major risk factor for high blood pressure and increased cardiovascular risk
                        and
                        is highly relevant given that 99 percent of U.S. adults exceed the recommended daily intake for
                        salt. Salt sensitivity is more prevalent in African Americans and Asian populations, including
                        Korean Americans, than their white counterparts.</p>
                    <p><strong>Dr. Ko is now conducting a feasibility study of investigating a salt sensitivity
                            biomarker
                            that is a critical factor of individual variability to dietary sodium intake.</strong> Until
                        now, there are no validated rapid tests or diagnostic markers to identify salt sensitivity of
                        blood
                        pressure in clinical practice. Dr. Ko is proposing examining salt sensitivity using a genetics
                        approach which is published in a recent article in her feasibility study. She is collaborating
                        with
                        <a class="underline">Teresa Johnson-Pais, Ph.D.</a>, associate professor/research of urology in

                        Biobehavioral Research Laboratory in the School of Nursing.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Ko has identified a sample of 40 Korean Americans in San Antonio with high blood pressure.
                        Study
                        participants were asked to have their blood drawn for the genetic testing of salt sensitivity
                        and
                        provide a urine sample for assessing their sodium level.</p>
                    <p>The pilot study is funded by $12,000 from the Nursing Advisory Council at the School of Nursing
                        and
                        $1,500 from an external nursing organization, Sigma Theta Tau Delta Alpha-at-Large Chapter.
                        <strong>After the pilot study, Dr. Ko will use a larger sample. “Then I can develop the
                            personalized
                            sodium reduction program concerning the sodium-sensitivity biomarker, and the final step can
                            be
                            modifying the dietary recommendations based on the identified mechanism,” she said.</strong>

                    <p><strong>The second study is focusing on why Asian Americans over 65 years of age get Type 2
                            diabetes.</strong> Funded by $35,000 from the Asian Resource Center for Minority Aging
                        Research
                        supported by the National Institute on Aging, a division of the National Institutes of Health,
                        Dr.
                        Ko is seeking Asian Americans in San Antonio who are first-generation immigrants from Korea,
                        China,
                        and South Asia, which includes Filipinos and South Indians.</p>
                    <p>Although Asian Americans tend to maintain a healthy weight with a lower body mass index compared
                        with
                        whites and Hispanics, they have higher prevalence rates of Type 2 diabetes, worse diabetes
                        control,
                        and higher rates of complications due to limited English proficiency and health literacy. Dr. Ko
                        wants to see if diet is a factor.</p>
                    <p><strong>Older Asian Americans don’t usually eat a lot of sugar, Dr. Ko said, but they are still
                            consuming traditional grains of rice and noodles as their major source of carbohydrates. She
                            wants to see what kind of foods they are eating and what kind of food sources contribute to
                            their high blood glucose.</strong></p>
                    <p>She has chosen metabolites as the measurable tool to gauge the response to their diet. Although
                        researchers cannot see every single metabolite, some studies have identified metabolites
                        relating to
                        Type 2 diabetes.</p>
                    <p>Her collaborators are Yan Du, Ph.D., M.P.H., RN, post-doctoral student concentrating on the
                        Chinese
                        population; Rozmin Jiwani, Ph.D., RN, who will help recruit South Asians; and <a>Jing Wang,
                            Ph.D.,
                            M.P.H., M.S.N., RN, FAAN</a>, vice dean for research for the School of Nursing and director
                        of
                        the school’s Center on Smart and Connected Health Technologies.</p>
                    <p><strong>“This population still needs culturally tailored care for their chronic disease,” Dr. Ko
                            said, pointing to the precision health approach.</strong> “Advances in the field of
                        nutritional
                        science have facilitated the shift from the general population-based guidelines to more precise
                        dietary recommendations. In addition to the culturally tailored guidance for ethnic minority
                        populations, we need to provide more precise approaches based on their response to the current
                        dietary recommendations.”</p>
                    <p>An appropriate method for measuring and assessing dietary intake is required. Digital health
                        technology can collect not only real-time food intake but also health data from people on their
                        own
                        timeline. It also contributes to enabling more personalized self-management of chronic disease
                        through acquiring personal data and formulating the most individualized interventions. Thus,
                        study
                        participants will have the opportunity to use digital health technology, such as a wearable
                        device
                        and its companion dietary mobile app and wireless monitors of blood pressure and blood glucose.
