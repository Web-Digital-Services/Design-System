                <h2> Important Update</h2>
                <p class="bold">Courses Taken Pass/Fail:</p>
                <p>Prerequisite courses taken as "pass/fail"”" or "credit/no credit" during the Spring 2020, Summer
                    2020, or Fall 2020 terms can be accepted as long as the course is passed and credit is earned.
                    Classes taken this way will not be included in the cumulative or prerequisite GPA. Failed
                    courses will not be accepted, but will be included in GPA calculation.</p>
                <p class="bold">TEAS Exam:</p>
                <p>The TEAS exam is being waived for all applicants to the Spring 2022 Traditional BSN program. For
                    applicants who have already taken the TEAS exam and have sent scores to UT Health San Antonio,
                    those scores will not be considered in the admission review process.</p>
                <p class="margin-bottom">For applicants to our May 2022 Accelerated BSN program and Fall 2022
                    Traditional BSN program: We will continue to monitor the pandemic and its impact on the
                    availability of the TEAS exam. The health and safety of our applicants is a priority.  Our goal
                    is to determine if the TEAS exam will be required for applicants to our May 2022 Accelerated BSN
                    program and Fall 2022 Traditional BSN program by August 2021.</p>
