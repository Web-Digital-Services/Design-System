                <h1>Toxicant-Induced Loss of Tolerance (TILT) Program</h1>

                <p>Toxicant‐Induced Loss of Tolerance (TILT) is a two-stage disease process initiated by a one-time major exposure, or a series of low-level chemical exposures (Stage I, Initiation). Affected individuals experience symptoms triggered by everyday chemicals, foods, and drugs that never bothered them before (Stage II, Triggering). Exposure examples include chemical spills, pesticides, cleaning agents, solvents, combustion-related products, drugs and medical devices, and indoor air contaminants associated with materials used in construction or remodeling.</p>
