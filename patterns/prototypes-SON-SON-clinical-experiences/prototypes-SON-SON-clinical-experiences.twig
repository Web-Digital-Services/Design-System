            <h2>Placement opportunities</h2>
                <p>With more than 400 active clinical agency contracts located within a 60 mile radius of the University, faculty and students in all programs enjoy the availability of a wide variety of teaching-learning clinical experiences. Clinical facilities include acute care hospitals, long-term care facilities, ambulatory clinics, community-based senior centers, schools, residential treatment centers, faith-based outreach ministries and physician offices as well as migrant-stream or rural clinics serving vulnerable populations with known health disparities. This comprehensive selection of available clinical agencies provides rich teaching and learning opportunities across all degree programs by exposing students to different organizational entities representing both large and small health care delivery systems with patients representing a myriad of health promotion and health restoration or disease management needs. In addition to these local or regional opportunities, there are opportunities for international nursing experiences.</p>

      <h3>Preceptor Model</h3>
				<p>Our preceptors are arranged by the Office for Academic Affairs, which is dedicated to providing health care partners with placements to help meet their mission and patient care needs.</p>

<p>Our preceptorship program allows for graduate students to be placed with a single preceptor or a team of preceptors.</p>

<p>While at other schools, graduate students are required to find their own preceptor, our School of Nursing pairs our students with preceptors.</p>
				<p><a href="#" class="arrow">Graduate Preceptor Handbook</a></p>
        <p>If you would like to serve as a clinical preceptor, please contact the <a>Office for Academic Affairs</a>. For our academic and practice partners, we have formulated a toolkit in collaboration with Veterans Affairs and Methodist Healthcare for use in developing a Dedicated Education Unit (DEU). <a>See our DEU toolkit.</a></p>
