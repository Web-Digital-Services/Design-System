                <p>Specifically, the goals of the San Antonio OAIC are: (1) to integrate and combine University and VA research and resources to address the health care needs of older citizens, and (2) to be one of the leading sites in the nation for clinical and translational aging research. The Center for Healthy Aging is responsible for coordinating the following integrated activities linked to the missions of the San Antonio GRECC and UT Health San Antonio:</p>
<ul>
<li>Patient-oriented clinical research in aging;</li>
<li>Translational research, taking the discoveries in biological research to the patient;</li>
