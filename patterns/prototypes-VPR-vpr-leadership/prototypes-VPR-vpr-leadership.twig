                                Interest (COI).</p>

                            <p>Dr. Potter is a national expert in substance use disorders with particular emphasis on
                                increasing access to evidence-based treatment for opioid and other substance use
                                disorders. Dr. Potterâ€™s NIH-funded research focuses on the design and conduct of
                                behavioral and pharmacological treatments for substance use disorder with a recent
                                emphasis on technology-based treatments for opioids and stimulants. Dr. Potter is a
                                recognized Principal Investigator with the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA)
                                Clinical Trials Network (CTN).</p>

                            <p>In addition to her NIH research, Dr. Potter is leading strategic public health
                                initiatives funded by Texas Health and Human Service (HHS) with the goal to increase
                                access to substance use disorder treatment for Texans. In 2020, the program expanded in
                                response to an uptick created by the COVID-19 pandemic to offer additional support for
                                people seeking assistance for problematic substance use and substance use disorder.</p>

                            <p>Other statewide programs funded by HHS include an outpatient opioid use disorder provider
                                treatment network, a peer recovery support network, a virtual provider clinical to
                                service underserved areas, a hospital-based addiction treatment initiation and
                                professional development for health care providers treating opioid use disorder.</p>

                            <p>Prior to joining the health science center in 2008, Dr. Potter was on the faculty of
                                Harvard Medical School and McLean Hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts. Dr. Potter holds a

                                Health degree from the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University.</p>
