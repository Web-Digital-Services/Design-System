      <p>Our clinics serve as a unique educational setting where students learn from their peers, mentors and their patients. Health science students & residents gain vital experience in primary care, public health, community service, and administration of health care while giving to others. The care provided to the community is greatly needed and warmly appreciated.</p>
      <p>Weekly clinics are provided at Alpha Home, SAMM Transitional Living & Learning Center, the San Antonio Refugee Clinic and Haven for Hope. Clinics occur every 2 weeks at Travis Park for Dermatology and monthly at the Pride Clinic. Students can sign up for upcoming clinic dates & times, under the Clinic Calendars link.</p>
