              <a id="3" name="3"></a><strong>EXECUTION OF CLINICAL TRIAL AGREEMENTS (CTA) </strong>
              <p>The University   of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio faculty and staff participate in   numerous clinical trial projects to study investigational drugs or devices.   These studies are usually funded by pharmaceutical companies and are an   important part of the process to assure the safety and efficacy of the drug or   device, obtain Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval and bring a product   to market.                    </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The Office of Sponsored   Programs (OSP) is responsible for reviewing, negotiating and legally executing   agreements from external funding sources. The resolution of many contractual   issues requires coordination between the external funding source, Investigator   and OSP; the involvement of each party is essential to a successful contractual   arrangement with mutually acceptable terms. Investigators should provide OSP   with a copy of the proposed agreement, Certificate of Proposal (COP), Copy of   the Protocol, and a company contact person as early in the process as possible.   IRB approval is not required in order for OSP to execute an agreement. To   expedite the process even before submitting a COP or protocol, please have the   company contact send the agreement electronically to <a href="mailto:contracts@uthscsa.edu">contracts@uthscsa.edu</a>.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Although each document   is reviewed on a case-by-case basis, there are a number of key issues that are   common to most clinical trial agreements. These following items will be   negotiated by the OSP with the Sponsor: </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>AGREEMENT PARTIES<br />
        All   Clinical Trial Agreements should be only between the University of Texas Health   Science Center at San Antonio and the Sponsor. The Investigator is an employee   of the institution and never is a named party to the Agreement. </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>INDEMNIFICATION<br />
        The sponsoring company, and the actual owner of the study drug or device if an   intermediary is involved, must agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Health   Science Center, the University of Texas System, its Board of Regents,   Investigator, officers, agents and employees from any and all liabilities,   claims, actions or suits for personal injury or death arising from the   administration of the study drug, including but not limited to the use of the   study results by Sponsor. The Health Science Center will only indemnify the   Sponsor for negligent activities.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>CONFIDENTIALITY<br />
                It   is often necessary for the sponsoring company to provide information of a   proprietary nature to the Investigator or his/her staff and it is important to   the company's business interests that the confidentiality of this information be   protected. Written confidential information should be stamped as such and oral   communication should be reduced to writing and stamped &quot;confidential&quot; within   thirty (30) business days. Access to confidential information (including the   protocol) must be strictly controlled and each Investigator should have a plan   for assuring control. All agreements must have a time limit for information to   be kept confidential by the Health Science Center. Our standard language is only   to allow information received from the Sponsor to be kept confidential for a   period of three (3) years after the termination of the Agreement. </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>PUBLICATION <br />
        Agreements must allow the Investigator the freedom to publish results of the   study. However, the company may have the right of prior review to identify   proprietary or confidential information. Approval rights on publications are not   granted to sponsors.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>INTELLECTUAL   PROPERTY<br />
        The drug or device being tested in the clinical trial is normally   owned by the sponsoring company and already covered by patent protection.   Although each situation must be reviewed on its own merit, it is the Health   Science Center's general policy that title to inventions arising from projects   designed and conducted by faculty, staff or students will be owned by the Health   Science Center. Clinical studies originating with the Health Science Center's   investigator usually afford the sponsoring company the right of first refusal to   obtain an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to discoveries arising   from the conduct of the study. If the study design (protocol) originates with a   company, then the UT System has determined that title to inventions can be   granted to the company because the protocol is based on that company's existing   intellectual property.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>INSURANCE <br />
        To support   the above indemnification the sponsoring company must maintain a sufficient   level of insurance. Each component of The University of Texas System is   self-insured pursuant to the University of Texas System Professional Medical   Malpractice Self-Insurance Plan, under the authority of Section 59 of the Texas   Education Code. The Health Science Center has and will maintain in force during   the term of its agreements with third parties adequate insurance to cover its   indemnification obligations.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>GOVERNING LAW <br />
        Agreements must either be governed by the laws of the State of Texas or this   provision must be absent from the agreement.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GENERIC DRUG ENFORCEMENT ACT <br />
        Many agreements include a clause which requires a certification that the   Principal Investigator and others participating in the study are not debarred,   and have never been debarred, under the Generic Drug Enforcement Act of 1992.   The Health Science Center must notify the company of any debarment or threat of   debarment occurring during the term of the study and usually one year   afterwards. Investigators and other staff members in the study may be required   to sign such a certification. <br />

    <a id="4" name="4"></a><strong>CLINICAL TRIAL MASTER AGREEMENTS </strong> </h3>
    <p>Master   Agreements are agreements that embody agreed-upon terms and conditions of a   basic relationship between UTHSCSA and a sponsor. Once a Master Agreement is in   place, an &quot;addendum&quot; or &quot;study letter&quot; is generated for each new study to be   conducted under this Master Agreement. The Addendum sets forth the items   particular to a certain study such as dollar amount, protocol name, and   principal investigator. These Addenda are &quot;attached&quot; to the Master Agreement.   This alleviates the need to &quot;reinvent&quot; in an agreement for each study with that   sponsor; the major terms are agreed upon and only the particulars need to be   negotiated. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Most Master Agreements have been developed by The University   of Texas System, Office of General Counsel, although some are developed directly   between the Health Science Center and sponsors. The Health Science Center   currently has many Master Agreements in place and the Office of General Counsel   is continually working revisions, renewals, and/or new agreements.

  <a id="5" name="5"></a><strong>BUDGETS AND FUNDING </strong> </h3>
  <p>Company sponsored   clinical studies are usually funded on a per-patient basis with provisions for   pro-rated payment for patients who do not complete the study. All costs   necessary to conduct the study, including salaries, supplies and indirect costs,   should be considered when determining the fixed per-patient amount. Sponsors   usually use one of two options when presenting a budget. They may offer a   certain amount per patient and ask that you work within that amount or they may   ask you to formulate a budget for them. Regardless, it is the principal   investigator's responsibility to ensure that the amount agreed upon will   adequately cover all costs associated with conducting a clinical trial.   Negotiation of budget terms by the investigator may be necessary. OSP will not   review budgets when negotiating the agreement with the sponsor. If requested,   OSP will evaluate your budget for compliance with indirect cost calculation   advice to ensure your budget meets your needs.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The Office of Clinical Research 
    can also help you with budgets; see their Guide at <a href="http://research.uthscsa.edu/ocr/OCR Guidance for Mgt of Clinical Trials.pdf">http://research.uthscsa.edu/ocr/OCR%20Guidance%20for%20Mgt%20of%20Clinical%20Trials.pdf</a>.
    <p>Effective July 1, 2009, the Health Science Center has put new billing grid and budgeting requirements in place; access these at<a href="http://research.uthscsa.edu/ocr/clinical.shtml"> http://research.uthscsa.edu/ocr/clinical.shtml</a>. 
    <p><br />
  </p>
<p>INDIRECT COSTS <br />
      Indirect costs for human clinical studies and all other industry-sponsored   studies are assessed at the flat rate of 30% of actual cash received. To   estimate indirect cost when the direct costs are known, add 30% of the direct   costs. The sum of these two figures is the per-patient amount. Example: If   $1,000 is needed to cover direct costs, 30% or $300 should be added for   indirect, bringing the total to $1,300 per patient. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em><strong>Basic   Indirect Cost Recovery Example: </strong></em></p>
      <p>$1,000 check received from sponsor for a clinical   trial.<br />
      Calculation: $1,000/1.30=$769 Direct Cost </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>DEPARTMENTAL FEES<br />
The below departments assess an additional fee for all industry clinical agreements. The departmental fee should always be added in your   budget as a direct cost line item and <em>not as indirect cost</em>. Certain   divisions also may charge such a fee. Please contact your departmental   administrator or OSP for the fee that your department or division charges. </p>

    <a id="6" name="6"></a><strong>IRB Fee </strong> </h3>
    
<p>The fee for initial review of a single protocol is $2500. This fee applies 
  only to commercial companies who are sponsoring a drug or device protocol. 
  Clinical trials supported by federal funds do not incur this fee. All 
  investigators submitting commercial sponsored clinical trials to the OSP 
  are required to include a line item in the study budget for the IRB fee. 
  This will be a one-time fee only, no F&amp;A (indirect) cost will be assessed 
  against the fee, and no additional charges will be assessed for the required 
  annual re-review or protocol amendments. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The IRB Office   will invoice sponsors for this fee unless alternate arrangements are made by the   investigator.<br />
  </p>
    <p align="right"><a href="#top">back to top</a> </p>
    <a id="7" name="7"></a><strong>PAYMENT SCHEDULES FOR CLINICAL TRIALS </strong>
    <p>For company-prepared protocols, sponsors normally make payments on a basis of   costs per patient, with a payment schedule based on interim milestones of   certain treatments/visits achieved. Other study costs (i.e. pharmacy fees,   advertising/patient recruitment costs, patient stipends, or costs for certain   procedures performed as necessary such as pregnancy tests or radiology   procedures) may also be paid separately from standard costs per   patient.<br />
        <br />
      For Investigator-initiated protocols, sponsors will usually   specify certain enrollment milestones that must be achieved before payment is   made. <br />
      <br />
      Pay close attention to the timing and requirements of the   milestones. Payment schedules may be appended to the contract as a table or   narrative, or may be written as a paragraph within the contract. Please see   below for an example of a common payment schedule for a trial with 10 patients   at $2500/subject. <br />

        An initial payment may be equal to or include the costs per patient for one study subject, or it may be a separate item for start-up costs. If an initial payment is based on costs for one subject, the sponsor may require subsequent payments be reduced by such amount to  recover that cost. Occasionally, proposed contract terms indicate that initial payment will not be sent until a subject is randomized. This situation is not acceptable. OSP will not set-up your project/grant until a payment has been received from the sponsor. If a subject is never randomized, no   payment will be received; yet the study will have incurred costs that will not   be reimbursed. Instead, the investigator should ask for a reasonable initial   payment that will cover startup costs. This amount should be adequate to cover   all costs incurred with initiating a trial (including the IRB fee) in the event that the trial never begins. <br />
        <br />
        Look at your milestones for payment. Will you be paid on completion of Case Report Forms? That may mean waiting until the monitor has reviewed the CRF's and sent them into data management. Will you be paid on completion of a subject's participation in the trial? This may delay   payments. An ideal schedule will reimburse after a reasonable amount of subjects have randomized or after a certain number of visits are completed so that your study account does not run in a deficit.<br />
        <br />
        Sponsors may also choose to hold back a significant portion of payment until all study activities are complete. Ensure that this is not an excessive amount. 10% of the total budget would be ideal. Final payment may or may not depend upon waiting until ALL sites are closed or until the study database has been closed. Pay close attention to this   because it can mean that final payments may be delayed for an unreasonable amount of time.<br />
      </p>
      <p>An ideal payment schedule would include the following: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Non-refundable initial payment that includes IRB fee and startup costs </li>
        <li>Regular payments with realistic milestones </li>
        <li>Final payment made upon study closure at your site </li>
        <li>Invoicing permitted for other costs   (i.e. equipment, advertising, etc) </li>
      </ul>
  <p><strong>Screen failures and early withdrawal of a study   subject:</strong><br />
    Not every subject enrolled in a trial will   complete the trial. Ensure that the budget and payment schedule provide for   these circumstances adequately. </p>

    </h3>
    <p>To obtain a Health   Science Center project/grant number for a clinical study the following   documentation is required: a completed and signed Certificate of Proposal (COP),   a copy of the study protocol, a signed written agreement between the sponsoring   company and the Health Science Center, Institutional Review Board (IRB)   approval, an a initial payment received from the Sponsor. Project will be set up   under PeopleSoft fund group 48002.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <a id="10" name="10"></a><strong>CLINICAL TRIAL PROJECT/GRANT CLOSE-OUT</strong></h3>
  <p>At the   conclusion of any clinical trial study there may be a cash balance remaining. If   expenditures incurred to conduct the study are reasonable in relation to the   projected cost and when all costs (direct and indirect) have been properly   charged and documented, the cash balance will be made available to the   Investigator but will be under the ownership of the department. For example, if   an investigator leaves the institution, he/she must receive approval from their   departmental chair before funds can be transferred to the new institution. Also   the project can be deactivated and the residual balance transferred to another   48002 project upon official request from the investigator once the study is   completed. <br />

  <strong><a name="11" id="11"></a>CLINICAL TRIAL   AMENDMENTS</strong> </h3>
  <p>An amendment   changes the terms of a previously executed agreement. If the amendment   substantially increases the dollar amount of the contract, you will need to   complete a new Certificate of Proposal (COP). A substantial budget increase is   considered to be above $25,000. The OSP may request a COP in some cases for   lesser amounts if necessary. Do not add the increase to the original budgeted   amount when preparing the COP. If the amendment deals with other non-monetary   issues such as extending the timeline of the study, a COP is not required.   Simply fax, email, or send a hard copy of the amendment for OSP review and   processing. Terms of amendments may need to be modified or otherwise negotiated   with sponsors to assure they are correct and acceptable to the Health Science   Center.<br />

        <a href="#" class="accordion-title">Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA), a.k.a. Confidential Disclosure Agreements (CDA)</a>
    <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
<p>A Confidential Disclosure Agreement (CDA) is often a precursor to a Clinical Trial. A company may want to send a protocol to the investigator so that he/she can decide whether to participate in the trial. The protocol may have confidential information that the company needs to safeguard. Once a sponsor or Contract Research Organization (CRO) has identified UTHSCSA as a potential site for a clinical trial, a CDA may be sent to the principal investigator (P.I.) to sign. In order to protect the Health Science Center and the investigator, this agreement must be reviewed and approved by OSP. CDA's are usually straightforward and require little change however; some CDA's can include requests that OSP cannot honor. For example, as a State of Texas educational institution, the Health Science Center cannot subject itself to the laws of other states. If the P.I. signs the CDA without Health Science Center review and signature, the P.I. will incur sole responsibility and the Health Science Center will be unable to support him in the event that the terms of the CDA are breached. Please note that some sponsors do not require a CDA.</p>

<p>All incoming CDA’s need to be negotiated and signed by OSP. To process your CDA, please provide the following:</p>

    <ol><li>Send a copy of the CDA that you receive from the discloser to OSP. Agreement should be sent via electronically to <a>contracts@uthscsa.edu.</a></li>
    <li>Include the name, address, telephone number and email address of your contact.</li>
    <li>If needed, include a note with any concerns you may have about the CDA.</li></ol>

<p>Once the terms of the CDA have been negotiated, OSP will send 2 original CDA's to the P.I. for signature. Once signed, return both CDA's to OSP for University signature. The OSP will send both originals of the CDA to the sponsor. Once OSP receives a fully executed CDA, a copy will be sent to the P.I. for your files.</p>

        <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
          
<p>Outside professional activity of a faculty member often takes the form of consulting. Consulting that does not interfere with the faculty member's teaching and research obligations is supported and encouraged by the Health Science Center. Faculty consulting provides opportunities for Health Science Center researchers to confront "real world" challenges, identify and work with practicing industrial collaborators, and contribute expertise that helps fuel economic development. These agreements, however, are personal agreements and, if not handled properly, can create risk as well as conflict with prior obligations of the faculty to the Health Science Center. The Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP) provides this guidance as an informal but hopefully helpful aid to those HSC employees who do get involved with consulting activities. OSP will provide informal and confidential reviews of consulting agreements upon request by a faculty member. This review, however, should not be construed as legal advice and, when in doubt, the services of a qualified attorney should be sought.</p>

<p>Faculty are also advised that personal consulting agreements may result in conflict of interest situations with their university employment and, as such, must be disclosed to their respective department chairman.</p>
<p>
The OSP recommends adding the following statement to any consulting agreement that a faculty member may negotiate:</p>

    <p><em>"Consultant is an employee of The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio and has responsibilities and research projects resulting from his/her activities as such an employee. Not withstanding any other provisions in this Agreement, the Company shall not have any rights to any work product, intellectual property and/or other works or materials created by Consultant as a result of employment with The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio."</em></p>

        <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
          <p><a>Incoming MTA Process Description</a></p>

<p>Material Transfer Agreements (MTA) are required when the Health Science Center accepts a proprietary substance or product from an outside entity for use or testing. Also, MTAs are required to send materials to another academic/non-profit institution. MTAs for sending materials to for-profit entities are handled by the Office of Technology Commercialization. Typically these require that some deliverable is provided to that outside entity (e.g., a written report) and specify limitations on what can be done with the proprietary substance or product. These substances are often unique and can include biological materials, chemical compounds, pharmaceutical preparations, other types of tangible research materials and at times even software. While there is no financial commitment from either party, there are often issues of intellectual property, confidentiality, hazardous materials and protection of humans that must be addressed. Often times, materials are required to be transferred for which a subaward or clinical trial agreement is in place. When these agreements do not specifically stipulate the transfer of such materials, a separate MTA is required to be executed. The agreement must be in place and endorsed by both parties in order to protect the liability of both the Investigators and the Health Science Center. If the outside entity is a signatory of the Uniform Biological Material Transfer Agreement (UBMTA) or can accept the terms of the UBMTA, this can speed up the processing.</p>

 

<p>All MTA's, whether for incoming or outgoing material, are negotiated and signed in the Office of Sponsored Programs.</p>

 

<p>MTAs vary in length and complexity. A few MTAs are simple one page agreements that require no negotiated changes and are signed and sent to the providing institution. Other MTAs can be as long as seventeen pages (the longest we have seen) and extremely complex. MTAs are negotiated documents that cannot be brought to OSP and immediately signed and sent to the providing company.</p>

 

<p>To process your MTA, please provide the following*:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Electronic copy of agreement from Sponsor (should be emailed from sponsor to Agreement Specialist).</li>
    <li>Email MTA Intake Form to Agreement Specialist.</li>

<p>* No COP is needed</p>

 

<p>If changes are required in the MTA (they almost always are), OSP will get in touch with the other organization and negotiate the changes. Once both parties agree upon the MTA language, the MTA is signed by a Health Science Center authorized representative. A copy will be sent to the P.I. After all parties sign the MTA, the materials are transferred. No project/grant is set-up since no funds are involved.</p>

 

<p>When faculty members transfer to/from the HSC, any material that the scientist brings/leaves must be accompanied by a MTA. New faculty members must provide OSP with a listing of materials that will be transferred from their prior institution. Once the incoming material list is received, OSP will execute MTA’s for all incoming materials. For faculty members leaving the HSC, a listing of materials that will be transferred to their new institution must be provided so that OSP can execute MTA’s with the transfer institution.</p>

If changes are required in the RA (they almost always are), OSP will get in touch with the other organization and negotiate the changes. Once both parties agree upon the RA language, the RA is signed by a Health Science Center authorized representative. A copy will be sent to the P.I.</p>

<p>To process your RA for execution, please provide the following to OSP:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Certificate of Proposal (COP)</li>
    <li>Send a copy of the RA that you receive from the sponsor to OSP. Agreement should be sent electronically to contracts@uthscsa.edu. (OSP can provide standard template for sponsor to review and execute)</li>

    <li>Copy of the statement of work</li>
    <li>Memo detailing if any inventions will be anticipated during the performance of the study.</li>
    <li>LAR approval if applicable</li></ol></p>

<p>All research agreements will bet set-up under PeopleSoft fund group 44095 (Legacy K-95 account). A fully executed agreement from sponsor and LAR approval if applicable is needed for project set-up. No initial funds are needed for the project/grant set-up. At the conclusion of the study the principal investigator is allowed to keep residual balance unless prohibited by sponsor. Balance will be transferred to principal investigators 48002 project.</p>
