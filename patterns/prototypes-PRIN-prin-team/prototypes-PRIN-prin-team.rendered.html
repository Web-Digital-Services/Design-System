						<p>Dr. Ashford is a recovery scientist with a focus on recovery support services, as well as the executive director of Unity Recovery, a recovery community organization. Dr. Ashford joined UT Health San Antonio faculty in 2023. He serves as an Assistant Professor to the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences.</p>
<p>With an extensive background in recovery-related research, he has developed a comprehensive understanding of opioid and other substance use disorder etiology and pathology, as well as the progression, mechanisms, and processes of recovery from these disorders. He has been particularly interested in the role of recovery support institutions (e.g., recovery community organizations, collegiate recovery programs) and recovery support services – including peer recovery support services - in the context of long-term individual recovery. His scientific research experience has exposed him to a range of theoretical backgrounds including psychology, social work, epidemiology, and ethnography.</p>
<p>As a master’s student in Dr. Brenda Curtis’s lab at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, he examined the potential for social media data to predict public health alcohol use outcomes, as well as predictions of relapse risk rates among treatment-seeking populations.</p> 
<p>Most recently, when completing his PhD, he has been focused on identifying novel forms of recovery support services, including digital recovery support services, and the ways in which these novel services can be deployed to populations with less access to in vivo supports or with a lower likelihood to engage in traditional supports. This topic was the focus of his dissertation and has resulted in a range of new research, notably the largest study to date on the delivery of peer recovery support services in the United States (Ashford et al., 2021).</p>
