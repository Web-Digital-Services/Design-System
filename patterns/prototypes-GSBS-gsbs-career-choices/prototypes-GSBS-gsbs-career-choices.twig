            <p>If you are a life science Ph.D., or are on your way to getting one, and are thinking about what to do
                next, here are five common jobs people choose after graduating:</p>

            <h2 class="h3 ruled">Academic postdoc</h2>
            <p>Unsurprisingly, 80 percent of life science Ph.D. grads go on to do an academic postdoc. This is because
                95 percent of Ph.D. students want to stay in academia and a postdoc is the next logical step in an
                academic career. However, it may not be the best choice for you as there are far more Ph.D. grads than
                tenured and tenure-track positions and only 5 - 16 percent of Ph.D. grads will eventually have their own
                lab. Also, for the first 15 years of their careers, postdocs, even those who eventually transition into
                an industry job, eventually earn 17 - 21 percent less than people who go straight into industry after a
                Ph.D.</p>

            <h2 class="h3 ruled">Industry postdoc</h2>
            <p>Yes such as thing exists. Most big pharma and many big biotech companies including Pfizer, Janssen,
                AstraZeneca and Genetech (now part of Roche) have postdoctoral programs. They offer many of the same
                benefits as an academic postdoc with mentors and opportunities to publish and present work both
                internally and externally at conferences, but with the added bonus of learning how scientific
                discoveries are translated into products in an industry setting. Salaries are also much higher than for
                academic postdocs, starting at around $70,000/year with additional fringe benefits usually including:
                medical, dental and vision insurances; life and disability insurance; 401(k) and paid vacation time.</p>

            <h2 class="h3 ruled">Scientific position in industry</h2>
            <p>These positions differ from industry postdocs in that you are not working on an entire project, you are
                contributing to a project. You will be told what experiments to do and will have less freedom than a
                postdoc. However, you will still have the opportunity to learn how a pharma or biotech company works and
                will be able to move up in R&D or move laterally into communications, business development or other
                roles.</p>

            <h2 class="h3 ruled">Science communications</h2>
            <p>When Ph.D. students and postdocs are thinking about non-academic careers, science communications is often
                at the top of their list. Science communication is a hugely diverse field encompassing many different
                types of jobs and sub-fields including science journalism, marketing, public relations, institutional
                communications, medical and technical writing, medical science liaisons and public education and
                outreach. The list is huge. If you like to write and present information and think this field will suit
                you, talk to someone who works in SciComm to work out which job would be best the best fit for you.</p>

            <h2 class="h3 ruled">Sales</h2>
            <p>If you want to work in industry but don't want to do bench research, sales can be a good entry-level
                position. It allows you to learn about how the company works and you can work your way up and across
                into business development, product management or project management. It takes time to find a new job so
                it really helps if you can make the time to start researching jobs, building skills and networking at
                least 12 months before you want to transition. </p>
