						<p>Austin graduated in 2014 from Texas Tech University, receiving a Bachelors degree in Psychology and Addiction Studies. He holds a Masters degree in Social Work from the University of Vermont. Austin is the former associate director of the Center for Young Adult Addiction and Recovery at Kennesaw State University. At Kennesaw State, he was a founding member of the Recovery Science Research Collaborative while helping manage one of the country's most extensive collegiate recovery programs. In June of 2023, Mr. Brown (received/will receive) his doctoral degree in Social Science from the Maxwell School for Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University.</p> 
<p>Since 2018, Austin and his co-authors have covered multiple interdisciplinary areas. He has published work on the impact of language and stigma in recovery, collegiate recovery programs, the political economy of public health, and the psychosocial variables, factors, and stages of recovery from substance use disorders. His doctoral work analyzes the ethical subjectivities produced within suburbia via arrangements of social, historical, and spatial constructions of differentiations defined by morality, knowledge, and suburban life practices, including his own substance use and recovery journey. Throughout his interdisciplinary work, Austin highlights how subjective and lived experiences of addiction and long-term recovery can serve as the central theoretical and practical source for developing recovery-informed science, institutions, and systems.</p>

Aaron is also a Regional Impact Manager with Community Medical Services a national provider of methadone and buprenorphine for people struggling with opioids Aaron co-produces a show called “Narcotica” a podcast about drugs and the people who use them, as well as the “Naturally Noncompliant” podcast, a show about people who stand in line and fight for safe supply. Much of what Aaron knows about harm reduction he learned during 15 years of living on the streets of San Francisco and Santa Cruz after escaping the Children of God Cult that his parents cofounded and ran, and that his family of 11 siblings grew up in. Aaron is a dual citizen of the European Union and his views often reflect European attitudes toward drug use. Aaron believes that the best way to combat stigma is for people who use drugs to organize and fight for the right to be treated like any other person. Aaron wishes to help bring about a revolution toward seeing people who use drugs as humans seeking everyday pleasure instead of immoral or diseased subjects. Aaron is a happily married father of 2 who encourages skepticism, reason and science as the paths to enlightenment and discovery. When Aaron is not working, he enjoys running marathons, producing music, scuba diving, reasonable drug use, reading everything in sight, and most of all spending quality time with his wife and three kids.</p>

						<p>Dr. Lechuga graduated from the University of Texas at El Paso with a PhD in health psychology in 2008 and completed an NIH-NRSA postdoctoral fellowship at the Medical College of Wisconsin in 2010. She has over 15 years of experience assessing the needs of Latinx individuals suffering from substance use disorders in the U.S. and Central America and developing, implementing and testing behavioral interventions aimed at reducing ethnic health disparities in HIV prevention and treatment while addressing needs assessed.

<p>Dr. Lechuga graduated from the University of Texas at El Paso with a PhD in health psychology in 2008 and completed an NIH-NRSA postdoctoral fellowship at the Medical College of Wisconsin in 2010. She currently is associate professor in the department of public health sciences at UTEP. The overarching goal of her research is to contribute to ameliorate the profound ethnic health disparities that characterize the U.S. health care system by developing, implementing and testing theory informed behavior change interventions that are culturally appropriate for Latinx populations. Dr. Lechuga employs a community based participatory research approach (CBPR), which entails forging and sustaining strong partnerships with community based organizations. Her approach is consistent with the socio-ecological view of human development which suggests that the individual is nested in a complex system and promoting sustainable behavior change entails targeting determinants of health operating at multiple levels.</p>
