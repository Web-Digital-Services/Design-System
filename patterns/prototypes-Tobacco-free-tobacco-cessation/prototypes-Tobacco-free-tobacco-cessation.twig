            <h2>Tobacco Premium Program</h2>
<p>Because UT System is committed to promoting a culture of wellness and disease prevention and also recognizes the costs associated with treating tobacco-related health conditions, members enrolled in the UT SELECT and UT CARE Medical plans pay a monthly surcharge of $30 per month if they use tobacco (in addition to the premium normally charged). All members will be required to provide a declaration regarding their tobacco use as a condition of enrollment in UT SELECT or UT CARE Medical coverage.</p>
<p>The UT System is committed to helping tobacco users quit by offering our UT SELECT and UT CARE covered members specialized programs at no cost including Smoking/Tobacco Cessation Programs, Pharmaceutical Therapy, and Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) at no cost to the member.</p>
