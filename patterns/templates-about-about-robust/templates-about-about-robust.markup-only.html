                        The Joe R. & Teresa Lozano Long School of Medicine at UT Health San Antonio is the largest
                        trainer of physicians in South Texas, many of whom remain in San Antonio and the region to
                        practice medicine. With full accreditation by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME),
                        the school annually educates more than 900 students and trains 800 residents.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <a>UT Health Physicians</a> practice is the largest vertically integrated medical group in
                        San Antonio with 850 physicians in more than 100 specialties. This is powerful for patients,
                        because specialists who are at the top of their professions work together in close proximity.
                        Only here can a patient see these specialists as part of one team, each talking to the other
                        about the patient's case. The spectrum of health care extends from primary care in health
                        maintenance and disease prevention, all the way through the most complex specialty care, such as
                        liver transplants or curing cardiac arrhythmias.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Long School of Medicine and UT Health San Antonio have a highly productive research
                        enterprise replete with basic scientific discoveries and state-of-the-art clinical care. World
                        leaders in Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, cancer, aging and kidney disease, to name a few
                        fields, are translating molecular discoveries into new therapies for these diseases. School of
                        Medicine faculty members regularly publish in the top journals in the nation. UT Health San
                        Antonio is home to the only National Cancer Institute designated Cancer Center in Central and
                        South Texas, and a National Health Institute funded aging center and clinical trials center.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        San Antonio is fertile ground for testing new clinical treatments because demographically it is
                        what the nation will look like in 20 years. The School of Medicine's clinical, research and
                        educational partnerships with University Health System, the military including the South Texas
                        Veterans Health Care System, and numerous state and private partners enrich San Antonio's large
                        biosciences and health care economic sector.

                        3, 1968, "there was great excitement and enthusiasm," recalled Marvin Forland, M.D., who was
                        among the first faculty members and still works on campus today at the age of 85.</p>
