                    investigative support to the police department by conducting timely and thorough criminal
                    investigations using advanced investigative techniques and forensic equipment. As professional fact
                    finders, CID detectives will conduct systematic and methodical investigations to determine what
                    findings the evidence supports and will not form conclusions in advance. CID detectives recognize
                    their responsibilities to the community they serve and are committed to investigating all criminal
                    allegations in an ethical and impartial manner with sensitivity toward the needs of victims and
                    witnesses. The Criminal Investigation Division is dedicated to providing superior investigative
                    services to the police department to preserve the quality of life that our citizens and visitors
