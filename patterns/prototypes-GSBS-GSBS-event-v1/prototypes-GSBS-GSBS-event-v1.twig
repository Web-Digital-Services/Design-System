                <p>The inaugural BioMed Career Fest was held in April 2023. The event was hosted by the GSBS Office of Student Success and <a href="https://www.enventure.org/about">Enventure-SA</a>. BioMed Career Fest provides opportunities for students to build one-one-one connections with biomedical professionals in both academia and industry. This program provides opportunities for students to explore potential career paths. It also offers advanced graduate students an opportunity to meet with industry recruiters as they begin their career transitions. A total of 178 people RSVPâ€™d for BioMed Career Fest 2023 and the university welcomed over 28 scientists to our campus for informational interviews with students.</p>
