                <p>Our research is focused on supporting quality of life among older adults living with a chronic
                    illness or
                    disability, such as Alzheimer’s’ Disease and related dementias, through community engagement, such
                    as
                    the Dementia Friendly San Antonio initiative. We use community-participatory research methods to
                    augment
                    the voices of people living with dementia to pursue research that is meaningful to them.</p>

                <p>Our research often focuses on social wellness, including social support, engagement, and functioning
                    to
                    improve quality of life and prevent loneliness among older adults living with a physical and
                    cognitive
                    condition that affects their functional ability.</p>
