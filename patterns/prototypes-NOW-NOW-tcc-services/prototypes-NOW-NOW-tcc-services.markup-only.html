        <h2 class="h3">Model of Care</h2>
        <p>The Transitional Care Clinic works on a foundation of evidence-based treatment. We believe in the importance
          of providing treatment that has been shown to be effective for each client’s specific concerns. </p>

        <p>Clients who require long-term, intensive services are linked by our care coordination team to a professional
          provider within the community who can provide that care.</p>

        <p>At the TCC, our goal is to support client and connect them to services that facilitate their recovery. We
          work to help clients stay out of the hospital by providing the following services:</p>

            <a href="#" class="accordion-title"><strong>Services Offered</strong></a>
            <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
              <ul>
                <li>Psychiatry/Medication Management</li>
                <li>Counseling</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Individual Counseling. Therapists use a range of evidence-based techniques, including cognitive
                    behavioral therapy (CBT), mindfulness, motivational interviewing, solution-focused therapy, and
                    behavior therapy.</li>
                  <li>Couples & Family Therapy. These services are designed to help enhance relationship quality and
                    satisfaction, improve family dynamics, and provide a space to share experiences or concerns with
                    partners or family members.</li>
                  <li>Group Therapy*. The TCC and its affiliated UT Health San Antonio clinics offer a variety of
                    psychotherapy groups. Each group has eligibility requirements for entry. Some are open to all UT
                    Health clients, while others require screening. Current groups include</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Anxiety & Stress Management, Wednesdays, 1–2 PM. Available to current UT Health patients on a
                      drop-in basis</li>
                    <li>Chronic Pain, Tuesdays, 4:30–5:30 PM. Requires screening. Please contact xxx-xxx-xxxx or {email}
                      to schedule. </li>
                    <li>Coping with Grief, Wednesdays, 4–5 PM. Requires screening. Please contact xxx-xxx-xxxx or
                      {email} to schedule. </li>
                    <li>Stress Management, Thursdays, 4–5 PM. Available to current UT Health patients on a drop-in
                      basis.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>Case Management. TCC case managers help clients find resources for needs such as health insurance,
                    prescription assistance, basic needs (e.g., food, housing), transportation, disability services,
                    legal services, and community support. </li>
                  <li>Peer Support. A peer is a person with lived experience of recovery from mental illness or
                    addiction. The TCC has state-certified peer specialists and interns available onsite. Peers support
                    long-term recovering by combining their experiences with skills learned in formal training.</li>
                  <li>Crisis Support. The TCC provides crisis support to clients through the Living Room, an area
                    available without appointment to TCC and NOW clients. The Living Room is open Monday–Friday, 8 AM–4
                    PM. There, a counselor provides help to clients experiencing a mental health crisis, such as a panic
                    attack, a significant increase in stress, worsening mental health symptoms, or the urge to do
                    something that could have negative consequences, such as hurting oneself. The goal is to help
                    clients use skills and resources to cope with a crisis and help them avoid hospitalization.</li>
                  <li>Relapse Prevention Workshops. One-time workshops are available by appointment to help clients
                    dealing with substance use problems develop a long-term recovery plan. These sessions help clients
                    use problem-solving skills to prevent relapse and maximize harm-reduction skills if relapse does
                    occur.</li>

            <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
              <p>The TCC offers its clients specialty services in three areas: trauma therapy, Dialectical Behavior
                Therapy (DBT), and Cognitive Adaptation Training (CAT) for serious mental illness. Therapists offering
                these services are specially trained and maintain continuing education, seek any needed supervision, and
                keep up with relevant research findings in those areas.</p>
              <p><strong><ins>Trauma Therapy</ins></strong>
                <p>TCC clinicians treat clients dealing with trauma using evidence-based, trauma-specific treatments,
                  including Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) and Prolonged Exposure (PE). </p>
                <p><strong>Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)</strong> is a structured treatment for Post-traumatic
                  Stress Disorder (PTSD). This 12- to 18-week individual therapy has been shown to reduce PTSD symptoms
                  in over 70% of patients. CPT is provided by specially trained clinicians. The American Psychological
                  Association Strongly Recommends CPT as a treatment for PTSD. For more information, please contact the
                  CPT coordinator at xxx-xxx-xxxx or {email}.</p>
                <p><strong>Prolonged Exposure (PE)</strong> is a specific type of individual cognitive behavioral
                  therapy that teaches client with PTSD to gradually approach trauma-related memories, feelings, and
                  situations. Treatment typically lasts 8 to 15 weeks. The American Psychological Association Strongly
                  Recommends PE as a treatment for PTSD. For more information, please contact the PE coordinator at
                  xxx-xxx-xxxx or {email}.</p>
                <p><strong><ins>Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)</ins></strong></p>
                <p></strong>DBT</strong> is a treatment for people who experience strong swings of emotion, often
                  including anger, and who may have difficulty in relationships. These people may engage in problem
                  behaviors such as suicidal behavior and non-suicidal self-injury (e.g., cutting, burning) and have
                  difficulties with depression, anxiety, substance use, or eating disorders. These difficulties often
                  relate to difficult early family experiences. The UT Health DBT Program treats only adults and
                  primarily consists of Group Skills Training classes. For more information, please contact the DBT
                  coordinator by emailing <a href="dbt@uthscsa.edu">dbt@uthscsa.edu</a>.</p>
                <p><strong><ins>Cognitive Adaptation Training for serious mental illness (CAT)</ins></strong></p>
                <p><strong>CAT</strong> is an evidence-based psychosocial treatment designed to improve clients’ lives
                  by helping them find ways around cognitive and motivational problems associated with serious mental
                  illness. CAT interventions include environmental supports such as signs, checklists, alarms, pill
                  containers, and organization of belongings to prompt clients to carry out helpful behaviors at home.
                  The interventions are customized for each client based on a standardized assessment of their needs and
                  challenges. For more information, please call the CAT coordinator at xxx-xxx-xxxx.</p>
