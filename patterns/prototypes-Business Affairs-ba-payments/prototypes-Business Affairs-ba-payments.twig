                <h2 class="h3 color">Direct Deposit</h2>
                <p>To sign up for this service, you need a bank account in the United States and a permanent social
                    security number.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Go to <strong><a href="https://students.uthscsa.edu/" target="blank">Student
                                Services</a></strong>.</li>
                    <li>Log on to <strong><a
                                href="https://cst.uthscsa.edu/psp/S90PRDT/?cmd=login&amp;languageCd=ENG&amp;">My Student
                                Center</a></strong></li>
                    <li>Click on the <strong>Direct Deposit</strong> link. The system will check for direct deposit
                        information.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If direct deposit information is not in the system, a page will display for the student to
                            add bank account information.</li>
                        <li>If direct deposit information is in the system, a page will display for the student to
                            either change or delete existing bank account information.</li>
                        <li>If direct deposit information is in the Payroll System, a page will display informing the
                            student to make bank account changes through the Payroll Office.</li>
                        <li>Once enrolled in direct deposit, there is a 10 calendar day waiting period before it becomes
                            effective. This allows the school time to send a validation file (called a pre-note) to the
                            various banks. After the pre-note is confirmed, all future payments will be made via direct
                            deposit.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="h3 color">Loan Checks</h2>

                <h3 class="h5">How do I get my Emergency Funds?</h3>
                <p>Emergency cash and checks are disbursed only at the student windows of the Cashier's Windows, at 301L
                    MED. Sudents MUST provide a valid UT Health San Antonio Student ID to receive Emergency Funds. There
                    is no exception to this rule.</p>

                <h3 class="h4=5">How can I find out if my check is here?</h3>

                <p>The Financial Aid Office can tell you when your check was received on campus. Add five business days,
                    to that date, to know when your check will be disbursed. Checks are available after 3:00 p.m.</p>

                <h3 class="h5">How do I get my Financial Aid funds?</h3>
                <p>If there <strong>is no outstanding tuition balance</strong>, the Financial Aid checks are mailed to
                    the home address in the Student System; therefore it is important for students to maintain the
                    correct home address.</p>
                <p>If there <strong>is an outstanding tuition balance</strong>, the Financial Aid is applied and any
                    remaining Financial Aid is mailed to the home address in the Student System; therefore it is
                    important for students to maintain the correct home address.</p>
