            <h2>Compliance Hotline</h2>
                <p>UT Health San Antonio is committed to an environment where open, honest communications are the expectation, not the exception. All members of the university community have a responsibility to address compliance and ethical concerns. To discuss or report compliance concerns, you are encouraged to directly contact the Institutional Compliance and Privacy Office at (210) 567-2014.</p>
<p>The University also maintains a Compliance Hotline and a Web Reporting website as mechanisms for compliance reporting. To ensure anonymity, the Compliance Hotline and Web Reporting website are managed through a third-party contractor. These resources are intended to supplement regular communication channels. Faculty, staff, students, and other trainees are encouraged to call the Compliance Hotline with questions concerning compliance-related issues or to discuss potentially improper actions if they do not feel comfortable addressing these concerns through normal administrative channels.</p>
<h3>You can report concerns to:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Normal administrative channels (i.e., reporting to the appropriate manager or supervisor)</li>
<li>The Compliance Hotline at 1-877-507-7317. Available 24 hours a day / 7 days a week.</li>
<li>Online at <a>http://uthscsa.edu/ReportNow</a></li></ul>
<p>Calls to the Compliance Hotline should be made in good faith and report misconduct rather than employee dissatisfaction. Remember that all UT Health San Antonio employees have a duty to report.</p>

<h3>Protection from Retaliation</h3>
<p>Individuals providing good-faith reports of compliance concerns and information regarding possible wrongdoing in the workplace are protected from retaliation and retribution per UT Health San Antonio policy.</p>

<p>If you have questions or concerns about compliance on campus, please call (210) 567-2014 or contact <a>compliance@uthscsa.edu.</a></p>
