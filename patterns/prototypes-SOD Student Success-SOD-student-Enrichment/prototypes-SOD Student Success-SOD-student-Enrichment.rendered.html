<p>The Pediatric Dentistry summer selective course is a two week long clinical course. In this course the student will be providing care to patients who range in age from as young as 6 months to 18 years old.

If the student is also interested in pediatric residencies, this is a wonderful opportunity to observe pediatric dental residents perform sedations and ask residents about the program. There will also be exposure to conducting infant examinations which will provide a great opportunity to discuss anticipatory guidance with parents. More importantly the student will be able to get experience in treatment planning with different age groups in which they can be somewhat complicated and may need to be referred to the operating room. You must notify the course director if you wish to register for this course selective so permission for registration is granted based on eligibility. Limited to 4 participants per session.</p>

<p>SELC 7119 is a third-year, two-semester course (3 credit hr.) that provides a series of comprehensive, in-depth case-based studies to foster critical thinking skills necessary for the diagnosis and understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of a variety of human systemic and oral disease processes. The objective of this course is to better prepare selected DS3 students to become more competent general dentists and foster students for acceptance into post-graduate dental specialty programs. Many of these residency programs either require or accept scores on the ADEA Advanced Dental Admission Test (ADAT, see UTLs below), or, in the case of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, scores on the USMLE National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Comprehensive Basic Science Examination (CBSE). Each week, two selected students are given an unknown clinical case where they are provided with a patient’s past medical/dental history, clinical features, physical examination, and appropriate initial laboratory, and/or radiographic findings. Based on the preceding information, these students must develop a preliminary differential diagnoses and seek additional clinical, laboratory and histopathologic follow-up studies to arrive at the correct clinical diagnosis. Based on the pathogenesis of the disease, a logical treatment plan is proposed. For each case, students will prepare a PowerPoint presentation and lead a Socratic Circle interactive discussion of the unknown case with their fellow students. SELC 7119 is a pass/fail course. The course will be given when at least 6 (maximum of 12) DS3 students demonstrate interest. The Course Directors will select students after an interview process. The first half of the course (General and Systemic Pathology) will begin in the fall semester (late July or early August) and continue through mid-December. The second half of the course (Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology) will begin in the spring semester (early January) and will continue through April. The time and dates for SELC 7119 will be determined to suit the weekly schedules of participating students. Previously SELC 7119 has been given each week on either a Tuesday or Wednesday from 7:00 - 7:50 AM in an appropriate location to be announced. Interested DS3 students should express their intent and reasons for enrolling by contacting the Course Directors (PINK and Dr. Jones), as faculty approval is required prior to enrollment by the Registrar’s office.</p>

 <p>By Dr. Dana English if you have any questions specific to this selective, please contact Lori Morgan</p>

<p>First year students will meet with faculty members to learn about academic careers: why did the faculty member choose to work in a dental school, what are the benefits of an academic career and what are the limitations of an academic career. Additionally, students learn about the roles and responsibilities of dental school faculty members in teaching, research , administration and service. Participating students prepare summaries of what they have learned about academic careers, submit these to the course director for review and then participated in a wrap-up seminar where teams of students share and discuss their experience and identify "take-home messages", insights and surprises about academic careers in dentistry. Dental students can take this course as a stand-alone selective without committing to the THP.</p>

                 <p>By <strong>Dr. Panagiotis Gakis</strong> if you have any questions specific to this selective, please contact <a>Nelda DeLaCruz</a></p>

<p>The objective of this selective is to introduce rising DS3 and/or DS4 students to the specialty of Prosthodontics. Through the application of advanced concepts and techniques, students will work with residents and faculty in all phases of clinical treatment and laboratory procedures for a complete denture patient treatment. Following completion of this selective, students will have improved their understanding of impression making, smile design, centric relation, occlusal vertical dimension, and relevant laboratory steps necessary for the treatment of edentulism. The selective will occur over a 2 week period and will be scheduled to accommodate patient availability. Due to the interactive nature of clinical treatment, enrollment will be limited to two dental students. Withdrawal, with notice to the course director, will be permitted without recording of the withdrawal on the student's transcript.</p>

                 <p>By <strong>Dr. Tam Van</strong> if you have any questions specific to this selective, please contact Eliza Rodriguez</p>

<p>The course is for select DS3, DS4 students. There is a need for many patients to have surgery to improve their outcome for wearing of removable dental prosthesis. Ideally, the patients would go to a dental residency program to have this surgical care. Oftentimes, they need a more affordable option. Providing these services at an undergraduate level allows patients to proceed with the recommended care at a cost they can afford. Students benefit by learning principles of wound healing and patient management considerations; many of these patients have complex medical, functional, pharmacological, or cognitive issues. Students are also expected to prepare in advance of the procedures for medical emergencies that might occur based on the patients' health history. Suturing and documentation skills will be enhanced beyond what is already taught in their dental curriculum. While Geriatrics often work with many students with pre-prosthetic surgery case planning and the actual treatment, selective credit on students' transcripts is proposed when a student completes eight surgical experiences. Enrollment in the course will be at the approval of the course director. It will be a Credit course if eight pre-prosthetic surgical cases are completed. If enrolled, and eight cases are not completed, there will be no credit, no reflected penalty, on transcript for this selective. Students can drop at any time. Students can express interest at any level from DS3-DS4 with no time limit for accomplishing the eight cases. The selective is year round and spaces are limited.</p>

<p>The molar endodontics elective allows students to initiate an appreciation for the knowledge and skills needed for successful endodontic treatment of uncomplicated molar teeth.  The course is partially self-directed involving self-study of textbook materials in Vital Source Bookshelf and other reading and video assignments in Canvas. Pre-clinical projects on extracted molar teeth are required prior to clinical participation. Students who successfully complete the course, including satisfactory completion of two patient molar treatments under Endodontic faculty supervision, will be allowed to treat selected pre-approved molar cases in the General Practice Clinic. Instructor approval is required. Available after completion of Endo 7043.  Withdrawal is permitted at any time without recording on the transcript. Prerequisites: ENDO 6041, 6142 and 7043.</p>
