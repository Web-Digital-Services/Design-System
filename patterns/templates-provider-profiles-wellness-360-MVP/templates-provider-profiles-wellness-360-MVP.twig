				<p>
					Commander Beverly C. Crusher, MD (n√©e Howard) was the chief medical officer aboard the USS
					Enterprise-D and its successor, the USS Enterprise-E, both under the command of Captain Jean-Luc
					Picard. She briefly left her post as CMO of the Enterprise-D to become head of Starfleet
					Medical, only to return shortly after. She was a Fellow of the Academy of Starfleet Surgeons
					(Sol Chapter). (TNG: "Encounter at Farpoint", "Attached", "The Child", "Evolution"; TNG-R:
					"Conundrum"; Star Trek: First Contact).
				</p>
				<p>
					As a fully-certified bridge officer, Crusher commanded the Enterprise-D on several occasions,
					most notably in 2370 while nearly the entire crew was searching for Data on a renegade Borg
					planet. The ship was attacked by a Borg vessel, but her quick thinking allowed the Enterprise to
					escape and destroy the Borg ship. (TNG: "Descent", "Descent, Part II") She also occasionally
					commanded night watch shifts in order to stay on top of starship operations. (TNG: "Thine Own
					Self").
