<a>Forum Theater</a>
<p>The Department of Medical Education in collaboration with the Center for Medical Humanities & Ethics and Trinity University offer opportunities for unique educational experiences exploring more challenging topics such as Trauma Informed Care, Cultural Humility, Learner mistreatment. The unique modality of Forum Theater allows us to present scenarios to participants, who subsequently can act in the play to alter the outcome of the scenario. The participants are called “Spect-Actors”. This type of theater was introduced by a Brazilian Drama theorist named Augusto Boal in the early 1970’s and used to effect social justice change.</p>

<a>ACGME/Texas Regional Hub</a>
<p>The Regional Hub was a collaborative faculty development effort between UT Health San Antonio, SAUSHEC and UT Dell Medical school and the ACGME. UT Health San Antonio hosted the inaugural program in November 2019.</p>

The Rising Leaders program has a longitudinal component for participants who have completed the initial Rising Leaders Program.</p>
